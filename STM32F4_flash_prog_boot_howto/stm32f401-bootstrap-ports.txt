Table 56. STM32F401xD(E) configuration in system memory boot mode
Bootloader	Feature/Periph	State	Comment

HSI enabled 	RCC		The system clock frequency is 60 MHz using the PLL.
		RCC		The HSI clock source is used at startup
(interface detection phase) and when
USART or SPI or I2C interface is selected
(once DFU bootloader is selected, the clock
source will be derived from the external
crystal).

		RCC		HSE enabled The system clock frequency is 60 MHz.
The HSE clock source is used only when
the DFU (USB FS Device) interface is
selected.
The external clock must provide a
frequency multiple of 1 MHz and ranging
from 4 MHz to 26 MHz.
		RCC		- The Clock Security System (CSS) interrupt
is enabled for the DFU bootloader. Any
failure (or removal) of the external clock
generates system reset.
		RAM 		- 	12 Kbyte starting from address 0x20000000
are used by the bootloader firmware
System memory - 29 Kbyte starting from address
0x1FFF0000, contain the bootloader firmware

		System memory - 29 Kbyte starting from address
0x1FFF0000, contain the bootloader
firmware
		Power		Voltage range is set to [1.62 V, 2.1 V]. In this 
				range internal Flash write operations are allowed 
				only in byte format (Half-Word, Word and Double-Word 
				operations are not allowed). The voltage range 
				can be configured in run time using bootloader


		USART1		USART1 Enabled Once initialized the USART1 configuration
				is: 8-bits, even parity and 1 Stop bit
		USART1_RX pin Input PA10 pin: USART1 in reception mode
		USART1_TX pin Output PA9 pin: USART1 in transmission mode



I2C1 bootldr	I2C1 	Enabld 	The I2C1 configuration is: I2C speed: up to 400 KHz, 7-bit
				 address, slave mode, analog filter ON. Slave 7-bit address: 
				0b0111001x (where x = 0 for write and x = 1 for read)

		I2C1_SCL pin In/Out PB6 pin: clock line is used in open-drain mode.
		I2C1_SDA pin In/Out PB7 pin: data line is used in open-drain mode.
