# Using Culture Shock v0.5 first article prototype
###  Intro
  The  v0.5 first article prototype has  no buttons -- all commands are done via a command line over the USB serial port.  
  New scripts to run are loaded by writing files to the culture shock using the USB port virtual file system files located at:
  * Windows, Linux, Mac: folder called PYBFLASH in the popup window for a USB drive when culture shock data USB cable plug is plugged into the USB port of a laptop.

  * Debian Linux:  /username/media/PYBFLASH directory

The project github repository, (that this document is part of), is the source of scripts to run for basic testing and as a starting point for your new recipes. The folder to find them in is: [code_PYFLEX_F401  ](https://github.com/kanzure/culture_shock/tree/master/code_PYFLEX_F401    "Culture Shock micropython code")
