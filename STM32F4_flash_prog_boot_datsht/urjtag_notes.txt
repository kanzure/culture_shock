TRST-: Resets the JTAG TAP controller and the CPU internal debug logic.
SRST-: Resets the CPU core and peripherals




 "SVF should be generated with only one device in the chain". It doesn't mean that you're restricted with it to chains with only a single device in them. It just means that SVF player can operate only on a single device at once, but you can select this single device in a chain of multiple devices beforehand. The documentation about svf describes in detail how to select the target:

The Standard Test And Programming Language (STAPL) format serves for
describing actions over JTAG interfaces. The STAPL is standardized in
JEDEC "JESD-71" (http://www.jtagtest.com/pdf/jesd71_stapl.pdf). This
version of the standard was developed by Altera and released to public
(read Altera license in enclosed COPYING file). However, it does not
cover the whole standard. Afterwards, Actel extended the code about
EXPORT command to be compatible with STAPL files generated by Actel
Libero IDE Suite. Now, the development is running separately. The idea
is to incorporate STAPL player into UrJTAG; thus, unite the
development and contribute from the support of vast number of JTAG
devices. Then, UrJTAG will become even more versatile software
package.

Compiled with latest STAPL feature
