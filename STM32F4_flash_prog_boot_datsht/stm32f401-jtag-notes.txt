Bootloader firmware of STM32 F2, F4, F7 and L4 series supports OTP memory in
addition to standard memories (internal Flash, internal SRAM, option bytes and System
memory). The start address and the size of this area depends on product, please refer
to product reference manual for more information. OTP memory can be read and written but cannot be erased using Erase command. When writing in an OTP memory
location, make sure that the relative protection bit is not reset.






For STM32 F2, F4 and F7 series the internal flash write operation format depends on
voltage Range. By default write operation are allowed by one byte format (Half-Word,
Word and Double-Word operations are not allowed). to increase the speed of write
operation, the user should apply the adequate voltage range that allows write operation
by Half-Word, Word or Double-Word and update this configuration on the fly by the
bootloader software through a virtual memory location.

This byte controls the current value of the voltage range.
0x00: voltage range [1.8 V, 2.1 V]
0x01: voltage range [2.1 V, 2.4 V]
0x02: voltage range [2.4 V, 2.7 V]
0x03: voltage range [2.7 V, 3.6 V]
0x04: voltage range [2.7 V, 3.6 V] and double word write/erase
operation is used. In this case it is mandatory to supply 9 V
through the VPP pin

Table 56. STM32F401xD(E) configuration in system memory boot mode
Bootloader	Feature/Peripheral	State		Comment
all		RCC			HSI enabled 	The system clock frequency is 60 MHz using the PLL.
							The HSI clock source is used at startup (interface 
							detection phase) and when USART or SPI or I2C interface 
							is selected (once DFU bootloader is selected, the clock
							source will be derived from the external crystal).

all		RCC			HSE enabled	The system clock frequency is 60 MHz. The HSE clock source 
							is used only when the DFU (USB FS Device) interface is selected.
  							The external clock must provide a frequency multiple of 1 MHz 
							and ranging from 4 MHz to 26 MHz.  The Clock Security System 
							(CSS) interrupt is enabled for the DFU bootloader. Any 
							failure (or removal) of the external clock generates 
							system reset.

USART connection timing is the time that the host should wait for between sending the
synchronization data (0x7F) and receiving the first acknowledge response (0x79).
Receiving any other character different from 0x7F (or line glitches) will cause Bootloader to start
communication using a wrong baudrate. Bootloader measures the signal length between rising edge of first
1 bit in 0x7F to the falling edge of the last 1 bit in 0x7F to deduce the baudrate value
Bootloader does not re-align the calculated baudrate to standard baudrate values (ie. 1200, 9600, 115200

USB connection timing is the time that the host should wait for between plugging the USB
cable and establishing a correct connection with the device. This timing includes
enumeration and DFU components configuration. USB connection depends on the host.


I2C connection timing is the time that the host should wait for between sending I2C device
address and sending command code. This timing includes I2C line stretching duration.  (a + b)STM32F401xD(E)
a. dur. of start + one byte sending through I2C.
b. dur. of I2C line stretching.

For I2C communication, a timeout mechanism is implemented and it must be respected to
execute bootloader commands correctly. This timeout is implemented between two I2C
frames in the same command (eg: for Write memory command a timeout is inserted
between command sending frame and address memory sending frame). Also the same
timeout period is inserted between two successive data reception or transmission in the
same I2C frame. If the timeout period is elapsed a system reset is generated to avoid
bootloader crash.
In erase memory command and read-out unprotect command, the duration of flash
operation should be taken into consideration when implementing the host side. After
sending the code of pages to be erased, the host should wait until the bootloader device
performs page erasing to complete the remaining steps of erase command.
