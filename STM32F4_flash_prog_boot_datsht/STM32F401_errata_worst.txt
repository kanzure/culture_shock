asynchronous trace can only be used with SW-DP, not JTAG-DP, since
they share a pin.

SD card:
SDIO HW flow control
Description
When enabling the HW flow control by setting 
bit 14 of the SDIO_CLKCR register to ‘1’, 
glitches can occur on the SDIOCLK output clo
ck resulting in wrong data to be written into 
the SD/MMC card or into the SDIO device. 
As a consequence, a CRC error will be reported 
to the SD/SDIO MMC host interface (DCRCFAIL 
bit set to ‘1’ in SDIO_STA register). 
Workaround
None. 
Note:
Do not use the HW flow control. Overrun errors (Rx mode) and FIFO underrun (Tx mode) 
should be managed by the application software.

I think this might be workable by setting the clock speed of the jtag_usb usb_blaster to a chunk less than the MCU clock for serial data...
