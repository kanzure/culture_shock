rshell

Remote MicroPytyhon shell.

This is a simple shell which runs on the host and uses MicroPython's raw-REPL to send python snippets to the pyboard in order to get filesystem information, and to copy files to and from MicroPython's filesystem.

It also has the ability to invoke the regular REPL, so rshell can be used as a terminal emulator as well.

Note: With rshell you can disable USB Mass Storage and still copy files into and out of your pyboard.

When using the commands, the /flash directory, and the /sdcard directory (if an sdcard is inserted) are considered to be on the pyboard, and all other directories are considered to be on the host.

install rshell using the command:

sudo pip3 install rshell

export RSHELL_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0

rshell--buffer-size=32 connect serial /dev/ttyACM0 57600
