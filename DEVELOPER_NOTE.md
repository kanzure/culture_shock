# GIT workflow methods
## Setting up your GIT clone with collaborators:
* Adding a collaborator's github URL
  * ```bash
    git remote add collaborator https://github.com/<collaborator_username>/culture_shock.git
    git fetch collaborator
    ```


## reset a collaborator's master to kanzure's master
based on this StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/a/39628366/253127)

* add the original (kanzure's) repo:
  * `git remote add original https://github.com/kanzure/culture_shock.git`
* Fetch the latest changes from the collaborator
  * `git fetch original`
* Checkout your __local__ master branch
  * `git checkout master`
* reset master to original's version, so your files match theirs exactly
  * `git reset --hard original/master`


## Merging branches (will usually leave a "merge commit" which rebasing can avoid)
* Fetch the latest changes from the collaborator
  * `git fetch collaborator`
* Merge the collaborator's changes (from master branch)
  * `git merge collaborator/master`


## Rebasing branches 
* Fetch the latest changes from the collaborator
  * `git fetch collaborator`
* Checkout the collaborator's changes (from master branch)
  * `git checkout collaborator/master`
* Depending on if merge conflicts are expected
  * If not, then use __non-interactive__ rebasing
    * `git rebase master`
  * If yes (or you want to squash/edit their commits/commit-messages), then use __interactive__ rebasing
    * `git rebase -i master`
* If there are merge conflicts
  * show the files in question
    * `git status`
  * use git's mergetool to see the your changes and their changes side-by-side
    * single file
      * `git mergetool path/to/file_of_interest`
    * all files in question
      * `git mergetool`
* Create a temporary branch for safety
  * `git checkout -b mergeme`
* Go back to __your__ last version of __master__ branch
  * `git checkout master`
* Merge your rebased changes into master
  * `git merge mergeme`

### Squashing commits with rebase
* I am currently using this method during debugging of the MarkDown syntax used for this note
  * ```
    git add DEVELOPER_NOTE.md
    git commit -m "sqsh"
    git rebase -i HEAD~2
    ```
* the last command allows you to modify whether the last (2) commits are applied, how they are applied, in what order
* I see the following output
  * ```
    pick 12e8eee added notes for syncing with other github 'forks' (collaborators)
    pick 7f7aedb sqsh
    
    # Rebase aebf933..7f7aedb onto aebf933 (2 command(s))
    #
    # Commands:
    # p, pick = use commit
    # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
    # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
    # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
    # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
    # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
    # d, drop = remove commit
    #
    # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
    #
    # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
    #
    # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
    #
    # Note that empty commits are commented out
    ```
* I would then edit the second line to read
  * `s 7f7aedb sqsh`
  * This squashes the commit into the previous (commit above it)
    * the goal is to merge the commit-contents into the previous commit, but hide the fact that the contents actually came from more than one commit (squashing all changes into a single commit)
* save the text file
* now rebase will open the commit-message, showing all the combined messages
  * ```
    # This is a combination of 2 commits.
    # The first commit's message is:
    
    added notes for syncing with other github 'forks' (collaborators)
    
    # This is the 2nd commit message:
    
    sqsh
    
    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
    # interactive rebase in progress; onto 7120033
    # Last commands done (2 commands done):
    #    pick 3a59de4 added notes for syncing with other github 'forks' (collaborators)
    #    s 63cf084 sqsh
    # No commands remaining.
    # You are currently rebasing branch 'master' on '7120033'.
    #
    # Changes to be committed:
    #       modified:   DEVELOPER_NOTE.md
    ```
  * remove the line starting with
    * `sqsh`
* save and exit the commit-message
* Done!
  * continue working, push, etc
    * during this debug cycle, because I continually edit the MarkDown, then squash, to test the web-browser rendering I then have to run a `git push -f` to force-push and overwrite the previous commit I made, because it was already made public


## Setup better git difftool/mergetool
* What look to be pretty good notes here:
  * https://gist.github.com/karenyyng/f19ff75c60f18b4b8149#file-git_mergetool_tutorial-md
* Setting a specific mergetool/difftool which is already supported by git
  * from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6412645/253127
  * example of open-source tools supported
    * kdiff3, kompare, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, diffuse, opendiff, p4merge and araxis
  * add the following lines to your `~/.gitconfig`
    * ```
      [diff]
          tool = meld
      ```
* Setting up mergetool/difftool that isn't supported
  * the stackoverflow linked from the prev also works, but looks to be a less-concise copy of this
    * see "Git 1.7.x and older" section
      * https://www.scootersoftware.com/support.php?zz=kb_vcs#gitlinux



# Creating table-of-contents for MarkDown (.md) files
* get this handy TOC generator
  * `git clone https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc`
* cd to the __culture_shock__ repo, then run the TOC generator on the .md file of interest
  * `cd culture_shock`
  * `../github-markdown-toc/gh-md-toc DEVELOPER_NOTE.md`
* paste the output into the .md file
* commit and push


# Preview MarkDown files locally before commit/push to GitHub
* Download `grip` with `pip`
  * `pip install grip`
    * source https://github.com/joeyespo/grip
* `cd` to __culture_shock__ repo
* run `grip`
  * copy the web URL printed on the terminal
    * navigate to it using your web-browser



# Self-Test Idea
* Setup 10 pulses with shortest possible pulse-width
  * setup list `adc_vals`
* Setup ADC timer with same freq as pulses, but out of phase 180Â°
* setup IRQ function callback on ADC timer, the function will:
  * read the ADC, append to `adc_vals`
* at end of pulse-train, send `adc_vals` out the serial port for printing on the user-terminal


## Debug setup
* PA0 and PA1, as seen here, are responsible for pulsing
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kanzure/culture_shock/0ed7805f742bc01429d4466670109e092e9572f7/hardware_schematics_layouts/kvboard.png "KiloVolt producing circuit-board v0.1 (2017-2-16)")
* Connect your oscilloscope to these pins to watch the pulse widths and periods of each digital operation from the microcontroller
  * These are useful to trigger on
    * you can then watch the analog/choppier high-voltage develop on another oscilloscope input
* With Culture_Shock v0.1, the G30TH module was used for the STM microcontroller it was built with
  * The pinout of the G30TH module is shown here on the right-side
![alt](photos_protos_tests_simuls_sketches/G30TH_module_schematic_PCB_pinout.jpg)
* Connecting the first oscilloscope probe to PA1 and GND (red minigrabber)
  ![alt](photos_protos_tests_simuls_sketches/probing_g30th_pa1_gnd.jpg)
* Connecting the second oscilloscope probe to PA0
  ![alt](photos_protos_tests_simuls_sketches/probing_g30th_pa1_pa0_gnd.jpg)
* Connecting the third oscilloscope probe and 1GOhm resistor to the high-voltage (HV) output
  * 33 kOhm dummy load is used between the HV terminals

## ADC pulse viewer GUI
* requires pexpect `pip install pexpect` and tk (comes with Python out-of-box in most cases)
  * pexpect is a terminal interaction library
    * you can send lines to a terminal
    * you setup what you expect the terminal to reply with
      * these act like triggers to tell your program your output was seen
* I used `picocom` for test and development
  * thus what I programmed the <b>expect</b>ations to be might need adjusted for other terminal programs
* the terminal interaction is logged to the command-line where you start the GUI
  * use this to debug why your <b>expect</b>ations aren't being met
* every time the __pulse__ button is clicked, the __a()__ function is called using the 3 input boxes for args
  * reduce the __Num Pulse Pairs__ for a first-try adjustment
    * you should see the waveform get shorter in length
* __NOTE__: this __is__ still __work-in-progress__, dependent on the ADC working, which is still WIP
  * has not been rigourously debugged, understood, or tested with conditions other than the default (starting) conditions for period, width, num-pulses

## ADC graphing on OLED display
* https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/drivers/display/ssd1306.py
  * http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/wipy/library/machine.I2C.html
  * http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/library/framebuf.html
* Graphing the ADC values will require scaling the data to fit.
* Currently with the DMA transfer the ADC reads into a buffer of length 2048.
* The OLED is only 128 wide
  * 64 tall
* scaling in the X direction may be done with averaging every (2048/128)==16 values
  * or a median filter
  * or a max-val filter
* scaling in the Y will use the ADC max-val and the height of the OLED (64)
  * val / 1024.0 * 64.0

# ADC DMA ideas

## STM selected documentation
* 11.8.1 Using the DMA
When the DMA mode is enabled (DMA bit set to 1 in the ADC_CR2 register), after each
conversion of a regular channel, a DMA request is generated. This allows the transfer of the
converted data from the ADC_DR register to the destination location selected by the
software.
Despite this, if data are lost (overrun), the OVR bit in the ADC_SR register is set and an
interrupt is generated (if the OVRIE enable bit is set). DMA transfers are then disabled and
DMA requests are no longer accepted. In this case, if a DMA request is made, the regular
conversion in progress is aborted and further regular triggers are ignored. It is then
necessary to clear the OVR flag and the DMAEN bit in the used DMA stream, and to re-
initialize both the DMA and the ADC to have the wanted converted channel data transferred
to the right memory location. Only then can the conversion be resumed and the data
transfer, enabled again.
